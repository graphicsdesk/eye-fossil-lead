            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In 2020, Columbia established the Climate School, a “first of its kind” institution that would grant master’s degrees to the next generation of climate activists, policymakers, and leaders. The following year, Columbia adopted a formal fossil fuel investment policy, announcing at the time that the University “does not hold any direct investment in publicly traded oil and gas companies, and is formalizing this policy of non-investment for the foreseeable future.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Climate Week NYC 2023, “the largest annual climate event of its kind, bringing together some 400 events and activities across the City of New York,” according to its <a href="https://www.climateweeknyc.org/about-us">website</a>, chose The Climate School as its <a href="https://www.climate.columbia.edu/climate-week">university partner</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But at least three projects at the Climate School have been funded by major fossil fuel companies, <i>The Eye </i>found. And in the 2021 fiscal year, when the University’s board of trustees adopted its fossil fuel investment policy, the School of International and Public Affairs received donations of more than $1 million from Occidental Petroleum Corporation and between $100,000 and $499,999 each from BP, Cheniere Energy, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Shell, according to the SIPA website.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Based on archival records of Exxon’s research with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory scientists in the late 1970s and early 1980s, fossil fuel company gift reports, and interviews with former industry employees, <i>The Eye</i> found a history of fossil fuel companies’ involvement with Columbia that continues today. The University has spent much of the last 50 years with a range of direct and indirect connections to the fossil fuel industry, which has grown increasingly influential in academia’s relationship to the climate.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to researchers’ personal archives, at least 12 projects conducted by Columbia researchers from 1987 to 1993 were funded by Exxon. Today, fossil fuel influence continues to spill onto campus through continued research funding across the University and through the presence of fossil fuel company officials on the advisory board of the Center on Global Energy Policy, a SIPA-based center that “develops evidence-based research to help address the world’s most challenging energy and climate problems through research, education, and dialogue.”

            <p class="g-body subhed">The Early Days</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In 1973, after Spectator <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19721113-01.2.8&srpos=14&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-president+mcgill+texaco------">repeatedly requested </a>that then-University President William McGill release a list of Columbia’s bond and stock holdings, McGill released a portfolio showing that Columbia held over $1 million of stock in Mobil Oil, Standard Oil of Indiana, Standard Oil of New Jersey—the predecessor of Exxon, which in 1999 merged with Mobil to become ExxonMobil—Phillips Petroleum, and Texaco, each.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Later that year, McGill was named to Texaco’s board of directors. The following year, Barnard’s president at the time, Martha Peterson, was named to Exxon’s board of directors.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In a September interview with <i>The Eye, </i>professor emeritus of history Robert McCaughey, author of <i>Stand, Columbia</i>, a comprehensive history of the University, said it was possible for others to see McGill’s public involvement “as a positive activity on the part of Columbia.” As for student pushback, especially in the years after the 1968 protests, McCaughey noted fossil fuel advocacy was a “niche issue.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  McGill spoke openly about his new position at Texaco, Spectator reported in September 1973. McGill said he had not consulted with Columbia’s board of trustees before accepting the corporate role and acknowledged that his new position might be politically controversial.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Almost exactly three months after McGill’s announcement, the Barnard-Columbia Attica Brigade, a student-run subsection of the national Revolutionary Union—which later became the Revolutionary Communist Party—called for McGill’s resignation from the Texaco board in a Spectator op-ed. The group also demanded that Columbia “divest itself of its $1.7 million in Texaco stock.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Barnard-Columbia Attica Brigade’s primary concern was Texaco’s role in the “oppression and exploitation of people all over,” the letter read. The brigade did not appear to be concerned about environmental issues, and the term “climate change” had yet to be popularized.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In April 1978, a member of the Revolutionary Student Brigade, the Attica Brigade’s successor, led a small group of students protesting for South African divestment across Low Steps after McGill attended a Columbia board of trustees meeting. The discussions were restricted to an account of McGill’s conversations with Black South African leaders and were not focused on divestment, Spectator reported. The students were particularly upset with McGill’s role at Texaco, which was known for its exploitative practices in South Africa.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the late 1950s and early ’60s, Columbia was heavily reliant on federal contracts to support science research—like the kind happening at Lamont, McCaughey said. But in the mid 1960s, as federal funding was reallocated to support the Vietnam War, McGill told Spectator, “it was clear that I must turn my attention more forcefully than ever to fund-raising.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Peterson called her Exxon board position “a nice opportunity to make some money for Barnard.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In October 1975, Columbia received $500,000 in donations to renovate Havemeyer Hall, including “two $100,000 gifts from the Exxon Foundation Fund and the DuPont Foundation,” <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19751023-01.2.2&srpos=3&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------">Spectator reported</a> at the time. Adjusting for inflation, one $100,000 gift is equivalent to about $570,000 today.

            <p class="g-body subhed">The Esso Atlantic</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the 1970s and 1980s, Exxon was at the cutting edge of climate research. Central to this research was a project known as the <i>Esso Atlantic</i>—an oil tanker outfitted with carbon dioxide monitoring equipment—which brought together engineers and researchers from Exxon and scientists from Columbia.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A 2015 reporting series by the nonprofit newsroom <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming/">Inside Climate News</a> investigating what Exxon knew about the effects of its business practices on the environment called the <i>Esso Atlantic</i> the “crown jewel” of the company’s research program.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wallace Broecker and Taro Takahashi were researchers at Lamont who consulted on the <i>Esso Atlantic</i> project in 1979. In June 1963, Broecker and Takahashi found themselves working together in an expedition to the Bahama Banks, according to an article Broecker published in 2008.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There, first using a chartered Chalk Airline Widgeon and then a Lerner Lab research vessel, I became an oceanographer,” Broecker recalled in the article. Broecker and Takahashi died in 2019.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In December 1978, Henry Shaw, manager of the environmental area in Exxon research and engineering’s Technology Feasibility Center, wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220216212722/https://www.exxonmobil.co.uk/-/media/Global/Files/climate-change/media-reported-documents/01_Credible-Scientific-Team-1978-Letter.pdf">letter</a> to Edward E. David, then-president of Exxon research and engineering, in which he laid out his rationale behind Exxon’s involvement in the climate research area: to assess the possible impact of the greenhouse effect on Exxon business. Shaw wrote that he was looking to establish a “credible scientific team,” singling out Lamont to begin a “cooperative program” based on the oceanography expertise of Broecker and Takahashi.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  That spring, Exxon representatives recruited Edward Garvey, a chemical engineering major at The Cooper Union, to work on what he said was described as a “new, exciting environmental investigation program.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[Exxon] wanted to be involved in how society would change its fossil fuel mixture, how fossil fuels would be regulated,” Garvey said in an interview with <i>The Eye</i>. “They wanted to have real scientists that were respected in the industry to say, ‘These are the concerns.’”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Garvey said Takahashi and Broecker, whom he saw as mentors, “only agreed to be consultants [for Exxon] if they had free access to the data and no limitations on whatever they wanted to say anytime, anywhere, any place.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Garvey said Broecker was initially skeptical about Exxon funding.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Exxon had to convince Wally that we really were serious about it. Exxon, Wally saw them potentially just as industrial hacks just trying to get something done,” Garvey said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Garvey would work on the project for five years. During that time, in September 1979, he enrolled at Columbia to get his doctorate in geochemistry with the help of Exxon’s employee tuition reimbursement program.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Then, in 1982, Exxon shut down the <i>Esso Atlantic</i>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Exxon saw strong revenues in the 1970s amid high global oil prices. But a global recession in the 1980s, combined with the nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries asserting control over oil production, brought Exxon’s production of crude oil from 6.8 million barrels per day in 1973 to about 1.7 million in 1985, according to Joseph A. Pratt’s “Exxon and the Control of Oil.”

  In June 1982, A. M. Natkin, the Exxon science and technology department’s environmental affairs coordinator, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Budget-Cutting-Memo-1982.pdf">sent a letter</a> to top Exxon research official Harold Weinberg informing him that the company’s climate research program budget would be cut from $900,000 to $385,000 that year. The funding was then slashed further to $150,000 in 1983.

  Garvey left Exxon in 1983 amid company layoffs. After switching his course of study from chemical oceanography to estuary studies—he didn’t like being at sea for long periods of time—Garvey completed his doctorate in February 1990.

  Still, Exxon funding continued to trickle into Columbia’s records. In over a dozen “VITA Binders” stored in an unprocessed collection at Columbia’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Broecker kept a chronological record of his publications spanning over his six decades as a researcher. The binders include Broecker’s work at Lamont, as well as his contributions to various scientific magazines and journals.

  Columbia received at least $5,509,450 from leading fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil between the years of 2010 and 2020, according to a study by Data for Progress, a progressive think tank and polling firm.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A Columbia spokesperson did not comment on the study.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Bella Kumar, a junior at George Washington University who authored the study, said most of the dollar amounts in the report were sourced from publically-available charitable donation forms the fossil fuel companies submitted to the IRS.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s kind of funny that the fossil fuel industry isn’t really trying to cover their tracks,” Kumar said. “It’s the universities.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia does not disclose specific donation amounts, nor do many other universities. A Columbia spokesperson did comment on the University’s policy on accepting or disclosing fossil fuel donations.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Out of the 27 universities that leading fossil fuel companies donated and pledged money to from 2010 to 2020 that were included in the Data for Progress study, Columbia ranked 16th, receiving at least $5,509,450. Princeton University ranked seventh, receiving $36,096,163, and Harvard University ranked 10th, receiving $21,142,825, according to the study.

  Alexandra Karambelas, a former researcher at Columbia who worked on that project, said the ExxonMobil collaborator with whom she worked would have to submit abstracts or the article to higher-ups in the research and engineering department to ensure that the research was “good” before the team of researchers published the results of their investigation. Karambelas said that she did not know what “good” meant, but said the process was not out of the ordinary and that she had undergone a similar process when receiving state funding for projects.

  In November 2022, a team of Columbia affiliates led by Almond published an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01521-3">article</a> in Nature<i> </i>pointing to the substantive effect of fossil fuel funding on research produced by energy centers like the Center for Global Energy Policy.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We were wondering whether there’s anything to test empirically regarding these ideas of what does industry funding do? Does it bias research in the climate and energy center space specifically?” Anna Papp, a doctoral student at Columbia who worked with Almond on the study, said in an interview with <i>The Eye</i>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Almond’s team compiled research reports from energy centers at 26 universities and utilized an analysis tool that looked at the sentiment of each sentence of the report. The tool scored each sentence on a scale of negative one to positive one based on how negative or positive the sentence was. The researchers then compared the sentiment scores of sentences that have keywords related to natural gas to the average sentiment of all of the other sentences in the same report.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We found that fossil-funded centres are more favourable in their reports towards natural gas than towards renewable energy, and tweets are more favourable when they mention funders by name,” the report read. “Centres less dependent on fossil funding show a reversed pattern with more neutral sentiment towards gas, and favour solar and hydro power.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Unlike some other prominent energy centers (<i>cf</i>. the University of Chicago’s EPIC), Columbia energy center reports do not typically face peer review by independent, scholarly journals,” Almond wrote in a statement to <i>The Eye</i>. “This removes a natural check on any pro-funder slant.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We are surprised that the magnitude of positive sentiment towards natural gas in reports from fossil-funded energy centers like Columbia’s was so large,” Almond wrote. “Indeed, it was as positive as that coming from the fossil industry associations, whose explicit mission is to promote the fossil industry.”

  Last spring, the Energy and Environment Center at CPI authored a letter to the administrations of incoming University President Minouche Shafik and Barnard President Laura Rosenbury in which they criticized the Bollinger administration for being “often slow, unyielding, opaque, and dismissive of student concerns.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The letter covered several environmental issues on campus, including divestment from fossil fuels, fossil free research, energy sourcing at Columbia, building efficiency, and water use.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In December 2022, Ruppert and CPI called on the University’s advisory committee on socially responsible investing  to recommend that the trustees direct the Columbia Investment Management Company, which manages the “bulk” of the University’s $13.28 billion endowment, to “cease all remaining, and abstain from any future investments in, private funds which are invested in public and private fossil fuel companies.” ACSRI, established in 2000, advises the trustees “on ethical and social issues that arise in the management of the investments in the University’s endowment.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The response, written by ACSRI faculty chair Bruce Usher, includes a clarification from the Columbia Investment Management Company on its “position on investments in funds with exposure to fossil fuel companies.” The IMC specified that through generalist co-mingled funds, 0.73 percent of Columbia’s overall portfolio is indirectly exposed to “energy investments.” The IMC further established that 0.31 percent of Columbia’s total portfolio was exposed through exchange-traded funds, as of the end of the 2022 calendar year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It is the opinion of the ACSRI that the IMC should continue to have the flexibility to invest broadly in funds and [exchange-traded funds] that do not have a strategy of primarily investing in fossil fuel companies,” Usher wrote.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ruppert said ACSRI’s response “sort of seemed to minimize any of the concerns that [CPI] raised.” The response came on May 17—the day of <a href="https://commencement2023.columbiaspectator.com/">2023 commencement</a>—so Ruppert said the group had little time to take action.
